Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
1.Define Software Engineering:
Its the systemstic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

b).What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

software engineering is designing and developing operating systems that manage our routines creating space for humans to focus on more complex problems.It differs from traditional programming in that ,it is more complex,more advanced in both quality and usage as its programming languages are easy to use and interprate.
Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)
2.Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
a).Requirements-this is the gathering of tools that you will need to solve the problems of the users that you have documented.
b).Design- this creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface, these are what the software can or will do and the login displays etc.
c).Implementation-this is the writing of the code and building the software according to design specifications
d).Testing-this is key so as to ensure it meets the set quality standards and functional requirements.
e).Deployment-this is releasing the software product to the user or customers in the market.
f).Maintenace-this is also vital.Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancments to the software after deployment so as to keep up with the users changing needs.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

3.Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Waterfall offers a more sequencial approach with distinct phases e.g requirements,design.implementation,testing,deployment & maintainance.It is mostly prefered for short projects and can be recognised in displays where words or images fall from top to bottom on the screen like a waterfall .Whereas agile is more iterative like alternating and has an incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration & response to change.Its most prefered for long projects where you have to add or omit things as you go on.
Requirements Engineering:

4.What is requirements engineering?
Its the process of eliciting,analyzing,documenting and managing the requirements of a software system

 b)Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
It involves understanding the needs and expectations of stakeholders,translating them into detailed specifications of stakeholders,translating them into detailed specifications and ensuring that the resulting system meets those requirements effectively.It serves as a roadmap for the development team clear guidelines on what needs to be built and how it should function .This helps streamline the development process and ensures that resources are allocated efficiently.
Software Design Principles:

5.Explain the concept of modularity in software design.
It is the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller self-containedand interchangable components called modules.Each module has a specific functionality or feature of the system and are designed to interact with each other through  well-defined interfaces. 

b)How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity improves maintainability and scalabilityby promoting code organization,isolation of changes,reuse of components,incremental development and flexible architecture which enable software system to evolve efficiently,adapt to changing requirements and support long-term maintainance and growth.  

Testing in Software Engineering: 

6.Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).
Unit testing-It is testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing-Testing interactions between different components and subsystems.
System testing-Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing-It is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the user needs.
 b)Why is testing crucial in software development?
 Testing helps identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher quality software products.
Version Control Systems:

7.What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development?
These are software tools for tracking changes to source code and co-ordinating work among team members.They enable software developers to write and adjust their source code freely thus enhance productivity,collaboration,and code quality by providing features such as code editors,version control,debugging tools and automated testing capabilities.
 b)Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
 Git:-Distributed version control system
     -Allows for branching and merging facilitating parallel development workflows.
     -Lightweight and fast.
     -Support for non-linear development.
     -Extensive community supportand integration with various development tools.
Subversion:
     -Centralized version control system.
     -Traditional client-server architecture.
     -Supports atomic commits and version directories
     -Offers branching and tagging features'
     -Integration with popular IDEs and development tools
Mercurial:
      -Distributed version control system.
      -Similar to Git but with a simpler command-line interface.
      -Provides built-in support for windows.
      -Offers branching,merging and tagging capabilities.
      -Scalale and suitable for both small and large projects.
    
Software Project Management:

8.Discuss the role of a software project manager.
Software project manager leads a team of people whose work is to achieve all project goals within the given constraints of scope,time and budget.They plan the project how its going to be done,allocate resources efficiently,provide; guidance,supportand mentorship to team members,identify,assess and mitigate risks that may 
impact the projects success.They also oversee the quality assurance process,monitor the project perfomance against established baselines and act as a primary point of contact for stakeholders.
 b)What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software 
 projects?
 -Ensuring clear and comprehensive understanding of project requirements and addressing changes in requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
 -Efficiently allocating the given resources to meet project objectiveswhile managing constraints such as budget limitations and resource availability.
 -creating realistic project timelines,monitoring progress and managing dependencies to ensure timely delivery of project milestones and the final product.
 -Identifying potential risks and uncertainitiesthat may impact the projects success by developing risk mitigating strategies and proactively addressing issues as they arise.

Software Maintenance:

9.Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities.
Software maintainance is the process of modifying or updating a software after it has already been deployed to ensure its functionality,reliability and usability throughout its lifecycle.
The different types of maintainance activities are:
1.Adaptive maintainance-It involves making modifications to the software to adapt to changes in its operating environment such as updates to hardware or operating systems
2.Corrective maintainance-It involves fixing defects,errors in the software identified through testing,user feedback or system monitoring.Aims to restore the software to its intended functionality.
3.Perfective maintainance-It focuses on enhancing the software perfomance,efficiency and usability by adding new features,optimizing existing functionalities or improving user interfaces.Aims to meeting the user needs and preferences whie enhancing the overall quality of the software.
4.Preventive maintainance-It involves identifying and addressing potential issues or weaknesses in the software to prevent future problems.
 b)Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
 Maintainance ensures continued functionality,adaptation to the changing requirements,enhanced quality and reliability so as to foster user satisfaction.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

10.What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face?
a)Privacy concerns such as personal information being leaked to social medis pages.
b)Data security-The storage of data especially for companies the information of their employees or ideas or money transactions get stolen.
c)Societal impact of their creations-majority of them develop something for the betterment of the human race but unfortunately some of their works end up being used to cause harm.(The cambridge handbook of Information and Computer Ethics editsd by Luciano Floridi)
 b)How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
 -Prioritizing user privacy y implementing data protection measures.
